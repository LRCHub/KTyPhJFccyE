La, la, la, la, la...
La, la, la, la, la...
Dream world
They say I'm in a dream world
They say our love is only a dream
That I'll wake up and you'll be gone

Dream world
They warn me it's a dream world
They say I'm in a fool's paradise
And that such magic can't go on

But your kisses are real
And the feeling I feel
Is something they can not deny
Oh, if they only knew
How you say I love you
They'd know I'm not living a lie

So if it's just a dream world
I'm happy in my dream world
That's where I found a dream of a boy
That's where all my wishes came true
Living in a dream world
A dream world with you

But your kisses are real
And the feeling I feel
Is something they can not deny
Oh, if they only knew
How you say I love you
They'd know we're not living a lie

So if it's just a dream world
I'm happy in my dream world
That's where I found a dream of a boy
That's where all my wishes came true
Living in a dream world
A dream world with you

La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la.
