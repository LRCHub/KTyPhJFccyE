What's tomorrow if no one's leading
Cheap loving is so deceiving
I can't follow you
Call it treason
I won't find, we found a reason

Not scared as I was before
Not afraid of love anymore
It's a bore but I don't get sore
Still not enough time to wonder what for

Choosing a Dream World
Where a heart plus a heart can equal love
Go make your own world
If there's not enough to choose from

Not hiding not leaving
I just needed to find a reason
I don't buy it call it treason
I can't sell what I don't believe in

Not scared as I was before
Not afraid of not knocking on your door
Forget the score there's gotta be more
Looking for love in the middle of a war

Choosing a Dream World
Where a heart plus a heart can equal love
Go make your own world
If there's not enough to choose from

When love is a treasure
That's the world I'll choose to remember
Make a dream last forever
Close your eyes but never surrender

Choosing a Dream World
Where a heart plus a heart can equal love
Go make your own world
If there ain't enough to choose from

Choosing a Dream World
Where a heart plus a heart can equal love
Go make your own world
If there's not enough to choose from

When love is a treasure
That's the world I'll choose to remember
Make a dream last forever
Close your eyes but never surrender
