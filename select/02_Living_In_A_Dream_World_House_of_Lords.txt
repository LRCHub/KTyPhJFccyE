Turn away, turn away
Turn away from the masses
There's no way to be saved
When you follow the iconoclasts
Our can see the world as all you desire
Everything you hear, celestial choirs
A preacher for your pain
Will teach you all in vain
Time slips away
Everyone prays
You're...
Living in a dream world
Sleeping as it unfurls
Dreaming of a free world
Gogol knew what's inside you
We are all in a dream
Close your eyes – fantasize
It's as real as it seems
You can lose your way in icons and pyres
You can run away
Or run through the fire
No blinding ray of light
