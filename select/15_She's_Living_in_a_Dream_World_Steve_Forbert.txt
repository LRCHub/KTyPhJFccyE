You don't care real from not,
You're a dream believer
You fool yourself a lot,
Such a self deceiver
No, I don't, yes, you do,

No, I don't, yes, you do,
No, I don't, yes, you do,
No, I don't, yes, you do.

She's living in a dream world
It's way up in her mind
'S the best place she can find
And she's high on that

She's living in a dream world
And, no, don't bring her down
It's her fantastic crown
And a turquoise cat

Let her dream if her life's a number
Let her dream if it makes things fun
Let her dream if it don't encumber anyone

She's living in a dream world
It's worlds away from us
Saw Streisand on the bus
And the Spruce Goose fly

She's living in a dream world
Knew Anastasia's niece
Met Jackie O in Greece
And saw Khrushchev cry

Let her dream if her life's a number
Let her dream if it makes things fun
Let her dream if it don't encumber anyone

She's living in a dream world
It's way up in her mind
'S the best place she can find
And she's high on that

She's living in a dream world
And, no, don't bring her down
It's her fantastic crown
And a turquoise...

You don't care real from not,
You're a dream believer
You fool yourself a lot,
Such a self deceiver
No, I don't, yes, you do,
No, I don't, yes, you do,
No, I don't, yes, you do,
No, I don't, yes, you do.
