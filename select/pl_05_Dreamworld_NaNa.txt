I wished upon a star tonight
To make a better place
I'm dancing
with the clouds tonight
No worries on my face
Your love is,
Is happy when I see you
Be with you always
So go to my dreamworld
And everything is real
When no one huts
and nobodyfs heart is broken
And with love I'll be there
Tell me what you feel
It's easy to forget
in my dream world
There's times
Iod like to fly away
And try out something new
Bur somehow
I keep goin' there
Only my heart can tell
Your love will
Will always find the answer
Almost to everything
So go to my dreamworld
And everything is real
When no one huts
and nobodyfs heart is broken
And with love I'll be there
Tell me what you feel
It's easy to forget
in my dream world
When I lie awake
I wonder what I feel
The reality can only
come from helping the dream
So go to my dreamworld
And everything is real
When no one huts
and nobodyfs heart is broken
And with love I'll be there
Tell me what you feel
It's easy to forget
in my dream world
So go to my dreamworld
And everything is real
When no one huts
and nobodyfs heart is broken
